## **Full Stack CHAT APP using Firebas and Riverpod 2.0**

### In this project of Flutter, I'll be making a chat application using Flutter with Firebase. Riverpod will be used for the State Managment part.

## What is state management?

- State management, in a broder spectrum, is managing dependencies in an organized and orchestrated way
- In a simpler world, state management is how one can glue together various layers of an application.
- Usually, it includes going through the service layer, business layer and then to the UI layer; it's how one glues together these three layers.
- One may have more (or less) layers in the application that may or may not depend on the states (or data) coming from the backend. This makes the State Management's definition _"fluid"_ and makes it the user's choice how he/she wishes to interpret.

## Getting Started

Let's setup the project first.

First, in the `main.dart` file, make a `stl` widget that returns a `material app` which has the homepage. After this, we'll define all the required classes etc. See the files.
